# Pinter

## Description
The website is a Pinterest clone that utilizes react/redux for the front end and
uses express/node/mongoDB for the API.
In addition to the general Pinterest features and the twitter OAuth sign in, the
design gives the pictures more emphasis by displaying the pictures º relevant data
only when users hover on them.
The popularity of the images are also emphasized where users can see the
number of pins for each image.


## Artitecture
This project is divided into a front end app and a backend api that need to be run separately.

## Instalation
For installing the backend locally, use npm install and run the app using npm start.
Since the front end is built using create-react-app, refer to client directory for the instalation instucitons.
