- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

##### Hint: Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
